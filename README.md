## Project Description
 In this game we need to guess the right number between 1 and 100 which is
 generated by the system randomly. 


## Technical Details

- **Language**: JavaScript,Html,CSS


## How It Works

1. **Loading the Application:**

   - When the application loads, the system generates a random number between 1 and 100 using Math.ceil(Math.random() * 100).
   - This random number is stored in the variable randomNum.

2. **User Input:**

   - The user is prompted to guess the randomly generated number by entering a value in the input field (associated with the guessNumberElement).

3. **Checking the Guess:**
 
   - When the user submits their guess (usually by clicking a button that triggers the checkGuess() function), the following steps occur:
   - The value entered by the user is read from the input field and converted to an integer (parseInt(guessNumberElement.value)).
   - The user's guess is compared to the randomly generated number (randomNum).
  
4. **Feedback on the Guess:**

   - **Too High:** If the guessed number is greater than randomNum, the application displays "Too High, Try again!!" and changes the background color of the result message to a specific shade of blue (#1e217c).
     
   - **Too Low:** If the guessed number is less than randomNum, the application displays "Too Low, Try again!!" and changes the background color of the result message to the same shade of blue.
     
   - **Correct Guess:** If the guessed number is equal to randomNum:
     The application displays "Congratulations!! You got it right." and changes the background color of the result message to green.
     A new random number is generated, and the userâ€™s score is incremented by 1.
     The updated score is displayed.
  
5. **Invalid Input:**

   - If the user input is not a valid number, the application displays "Provide a valid input" and changes the background color of the result message to the same shade of blue used for incorrect guesses.
  
6. **Clearing Input Field:**

   - Regardless of the outcome, the input field is cleared after each guess to allow the user to enter a new guess.
  
7. **Restarting the Game:**

   - If the user clicks the restart button (associated with reStartBtn), the following steps occur:
   - The score is reset to 0.
   - The score display is updated to show the reset score.
   - The input field is cleared.
   - The result message is cleared and its background color is set to a different shade of blue (#246db6).
The game loop allows the user to continue guessing until they get the correct number, at which point a new number is generated and the user can start guessing again, all while tracking their score.
